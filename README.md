## Project plan:

1. Build skeleton using HTML and SASS.
   - mixture of flex and grid base
   - fonts and colors in variables
2. Add initial button functions using JS
   - 7 classes for buttons: numbers, operators, float, plus-minus, clear, equal, delete
   - Buttons value to show on display
3. Add functioning operators
   - Need a lot of research by looking for specific functions rather than calculator specific answers
4. Celebrate success
